   a) This Gives you an error because inside the Where clause cannot solve for the average 
rather it just compares two things, solving is not what a where clause does.
   b) To fix this you just need to solve for average using a subquery and solving the average
and actually letting the where clause compare the solved average and comparing the base and avg
SELECT LastName FROM SalesPeople WHERE base < (SELECT avg(base) FROM SalesPeople);

   a) You need to add all the people om the military units and there ranks with serial numbers
including Smith with special rank of Lieutenant with Serial Num: 123. 
   b) //To add a military unit in general
	INSERT Personnel VALUES ( (RankOfMilitaryUnit),(LastNameOFMilitaryUnit),(FirstNameOFMilitaryUnit),(SerialNumOFMilitaryUnit));
      //To add Smith 
        INSERT Personnel VALUES ( Lieutenant, Smith, (SmithsFirstName), 123);

   a) This means to ask what is 1 = false since 1 = 1 is 1 it replaces that with 1 and false is replace to 0 
so is asking for 1 = 0, since 1 = 0 is not true it returns false. Which is 0.
   b) The query returns 0 since null is null is true which returns 1 and it compares with 0
so its replaces everything like, 0 = 1 and since its not true it returns false which is 0.
The reason it returns 0 is because 0 is not the same as 1 returning false giving final answer 0.
