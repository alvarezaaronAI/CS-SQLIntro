1) SELECT SalesID,Firstname,LastName FROM SalesPeople JOIN Studios USING (SalesID);

2) SELECT SalesPeople.SalesID, SalesPeople.LastName FROM SalesPeople JOIN Members USING (SalesID)
WHERE Birthday LIKE ('_ _ _ _-07-');

3) SELECT DISTINCT StudioName FROM Studios JOIN Titles USING (StudioID) WHERE Genre NOT LIKE ('%jazz');

4) SELECT StudioName, TrackTitle FROM Studios JOIN Titles USING (StudioID) JOIN Tracks USING (TitleID)
ORDER BY StudioID;

5)
   a) SELECT TrackTitle FROM Tracks JOIN Titles USING (TitleID) JOIN Artists USING (ArtistID) JOIN xrefArtistsMembers
USING (ArtistID) JOIN Members USING (MemberID) WHERE FirstName = 'Bryce' && LastName = 'Sanders';
   b) I Would probably look at the MemeberID and which only happens that this Bryce Sanders has a memeber ID of 3
therefore if i could possible add another conditinal statement where it only selects this specific Bryce Sanders, it will
eliminate all the other possible named Bryce Sanders with different songs

6) SELECT FirstName,LastName CASE WHEN WorkPhone is null then HomePhone ELSE WorkPhone END FROM Members;
