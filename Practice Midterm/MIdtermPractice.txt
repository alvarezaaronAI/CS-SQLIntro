3)
The following the date cannot be added
SalesID: Smith
 Lastname: 70
 Firstname: 80 
 Initials: 90
 Base: Jhon
 Supervisor: Howard

4)
The query avarage will produce 5100

5)
The query returns empty set because Natural Join, joins the two colums side
to side next to eachother only if both colums are in the same table, 
Memebers table and Studios tables are not in the same table therefore, 
It returns empty set, because there are two different tables trying to be join
naturally to one.

6)
Different results for the reason that When joining both tables (Titles and Studio)and 
match each id from both tables and only display the studioNames if non of the titlesid 
have non-jazz music on them meaning you can have studio name with non jazz titles and the same
studio with jazz titles, thefore displaying the studio even if they have both non jazz and jazz genres in their studios
The second query only focus on the left, therefore if any of the titles have jazz, the studioname towards that jazz, will not appear

7) 
This would give the first and last name seperated by a comma of the Member table
and would get the length of the longest part of either their first or last name and
set it as MAX in a new colum. 

8)
This query would get non main contact persons in the members table and display the names 
of those non main contacts, and display its artist name along side to it.

SELECT SUM (Birthday/365.25) FROM Members WHERE Region = "VA";

10)
SELECT S.FirstName, S.LastName, ST.StudioName FROM SalesPeople S 
Join Studios ST WHERE (S.SalesID = ST.SalesID);

11)
SELECT TR.TRackTitle, AR.ArtistName AS(By the Bullets?) FROM Artist AR 
JOIN Titles T On (AR.ArtistID = T.TitlesID) JOIN Tracks TR ON T.TitleID =
TR.TitleID;

 CASE (TR.TrackTitle = )
12)
Table one "SalesPoeple" would include the Names,Birthday,Adress,PhoneNumber,Initials of all the Salespeople  and its supervisor 
Second Table "Scissors" Would include the names,Type,DateItWasMade,ManufactureID of all the scissors incoming to the store.
Third Table "Manufacture"would include the BrandName,ManufactureID,Adress,Location of the Manufacture scissors itself.
