1) SELECT A.ArtistName, A.ArtistID FROM Artists A LEFT JOIN Titles T ON (A.ArtistID=T.ArtistID)
WHERE WebAddress IS NOT NULL AND T.Title IS NULL;

2) SELECT FirstName AS Subordinate, SalesID AS Supervisor FROM SalesPeople WHERE Supervisor IS
NOT NULL;

3) SELECT SP2.FirstName FROM SalesPeople SP1 JOIN SalesPeople SP2 ON (SP1.Supervisor=SP2.SalesID);

4) SELECT S.SalesID, CASE WHEN MemberID IS NULL THEN 'No Members Assigned' ELSE MemberID END AS 
Clients FROM SalesPeople S LEFT JOIN Members M ON (M.SalesID=S.SalesID);

5) SELECT S.FirstName FROM SalesPeople S LEFT JOIN Members M ON (S.SalesID=M.SalesID AND M.Region!='CA')
WHERE M.SalesID IS NULL;

6) 
    a) SELECT DISTINCT S.FirstName FROM SalesPeople S JOIN Members M ON (S.SalesID=M.SalesID) 
WHERE M.Region != "CA";
    b) The results are basically different for the reason that the first query will not show the
sale person who are not located in california, even if the sale person has others members who 
are not located in california, while the second query does give you the same issue, it would just
remove the member of the list resulting the same query without the members who are not located 
in california.
