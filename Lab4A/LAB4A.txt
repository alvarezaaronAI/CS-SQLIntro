1) The difference is that an inner join returns values that both tables that have the same
thing in commons, eg MemberID from two tables where the both have member id. Outer Join is
where both of the tables wouldnt have anything in common but you want to display them side by
side. Ex) Members table and Tracks, have nothing in common but you want both tables side by side
you will use outer join.

2) To not cunfuse the table what information you want to recieve or compare or deal with. 

3) This is wrong since it would check also the last name of the sales person, so if its that case
lets just say we have a scenerio where the last name of the sales person is Sanders, causing that specific sanders
to be crossed out as well.

4) The first query will remove the entire band if one of the members born from 1960 meanwhile
the other query will just not display the member whos was born in the 1960, not affecting the band it self.


6) This query will display all the genres and titles next to each other, identifying each title with
its proper genre and alphabetically order them by genre. If theres no title with the specific
genre given, it will display nothing(null). 

7) This will display the genre where theres no titles what so ever, displaying a table with null
titles.

8) This will display all the sales id with last names of the Sales people with the exception that,
when the salesperson doesnt have a studio name, instead of displaying null it will display none.

9)This query will display all the sales id from the sales people where the studios is not null and 
and they are not from california.
