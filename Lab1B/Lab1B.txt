1)SQL

2)This means that what we do is not required a series of steps that will solve a problem like
algorithm, rather it will be described by the programmer what specifically what data he/she wants. 

3)Titles

4)Tracks

5)TitleId 

6)Members

7)This just means that for every title there is a studio behind it and if you want to know
more about the studio you just go more into the studios folder and see what information does the studio have.

8) This just means that that there is sales person assign to every member and to figure out
the sales persons id you just go to the next folder and see its information. 

9) Because you need to know the information for each artist (bullets) and you need to know which of the memebers in 
which we wanna access the information, and finally once we get to the memebers information we can access individuals 
members of the Bullets artist. We need all three to access its content.
