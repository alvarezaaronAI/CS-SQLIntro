IN checks wether two querries data are the same, if so then IN output is any
data that is the same between two querries. Unlike the Exists, it checks wether
the data between one querrie exist inside the other querrie giving an true or false
scenrio

The problem with the code is that is setting both querries equal to eachother
giving you mutiple rows, essentially both querries giving more then one row, so

querry is attempting to execute mutiple rows but cant becuase the = sign.
