1) The primary key for the Studios Table is StudioID

2) This shouldnt be the primary key because a primary key is unique and for LastName to be 
a primary key is not possible, there might be a high chance it will repeat LastName

3) The foreign key in the Tracks table is TrackNum

4) We need three seperate tables to allow to know both the Artist and the members in the Artist table
For, example we need to know each member from ArtistName

5) 
 a)The Primary key for the XRefArtistsMembers is MemberID

 b)The Primary Key is the only possible primary key because is use to identify each uniquely without 
  having any reapeting it self. Its used to identify only one person in this case. 

6) 
 a)Yes we can add this new record becuase one the Primary key has not been compromised, its still unique to
this table which is 5, there is no 5 currently taking up the spot, so yes. 

 b)No we cannot add this new record because the Primary Key is being compromised, Its no longer 
a unique ID 4 since the person SCOTT BULL already has that primary key, therefore its not a Primary key no more
its not unique.

7) 
	Well SELECT (NULL IS NOT NULL) is just basically 0 
	because if NULL is not NULL then the answer must not be a null, otherwise 0

	But then we see that "SELECT (NULL IS NOT NULL) ={ 0 or False}!= ( (NULL = (NOT NULL));
	
	The (NULL = (NOT NULL)); is an answer of NULL since no value is equal to NULL the answer to this side
	the answer is NULL, so then we can say

	False != NULL... Based on what we learned we said that (NULL IS NOT NULL) is False and since in this case (FALSE = NULL) is not the same as 
	(NULL IS NOT NULL to equal FALSE), therefore its null.
