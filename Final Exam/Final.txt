 The purpose of the xrefArtistsMembers is to have two two different sorts 
of information such as an artist consist of all the members in that artist.
So the table xref relates to that where it manages to get match up the 
members that belong to a specific artist making it easier to just get the 
members from a specific artist.

 Well for this case it would Delete all the data inside the product tables
but since its rolling back it ensetially just goes back and gives 
the values inside the product table back, so nothing would have been errased.

  a) well yes we dont want the sonata artist but we want to get them so then
we can advoid them. The only reason we want the sonata artist is so then we can 
choose not to get them.
  b) Well when you do a left join you are checking for values that are in the 
left and since thats the case any values on the right would end up being 
null if a special condtion in the query happens leaving with null answers 
WHERE the where condition looks for and those who have null it ends up 
retrieving getting us the answer we want.

4)
MAX Condition looks for the maximum value given inside the table rows. 
While Greatest Condition it gives the greatest number between two conditions
Such as GREATEST(condtionA,CondtionB) which ever a or b is bigger greatest 
would retrieve.
